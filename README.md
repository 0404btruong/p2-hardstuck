## Project Plan

Our planned project is a table that shows 5 song recomendations pulled from a music api. We will have user interaction in the way that you can play a quiz game that tests your music knowledge, and you can search for songs and a summary of them with data pulled from an api. The Quiz gives you the genre, song name, and a little information on the artist and scores you based on right or wrong answers. The song look up lets you search up any given song as long as you know the name and artist and tells you what album the song is from.

## Step by step instructions
 
 Main page of website is self explanatory just scroll down and you can see 5 song recomendations
 Toward of the middle of the page, you'll see two buttons
 click "go to artist quiz" if you want to play a fun quiz to test your music knowledge!
 click "go to song lookup" if you want to find more details about your favorite songs.

Artist quiz instructions: just type the name of the artist in the given textbox and hit go. It will tell you if you were right or wrong in the text above the question. Whenever you want to go back, hit the home button at the top of the page.
Song lookup instructions: just put in the name of the song and the artist into the two testboxes and hit go. It will return a new textbox with information about the song you searched. Whenever you want to go back, hit the home button at the top of the page.
