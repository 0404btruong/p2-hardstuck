            <h3><strong>What is Music Project?</strong>
                Music project is a website that does lots of things related to music.
                One of these things are right below, where it recommends 5 songs to listen.
                This is accomplished through accessing a public API and selecting 5 good songs from a wide variety of songs.
                The artist quiz button will take you to a little minigame, where you test your knowledge of songs.
                This works by prearranging values for the API access so that it can check the submission with the correct answer.
                Song lookup is a simple API access point that returns summaries for a song that you enter.
                The taskbar contains access to the people pages as well as to the subscription page.
